# Apologies

This is a truly awful piece of code with so many opportunities for improvement, reducing code duplication, improving memory usage, runtime complexity, you name it. However, it gets the job done and at this moment I do not feel like actually improving it. :D Perhaps in a distant future where I'll add some additional boilerplate to also add unit tests based on the examples.
